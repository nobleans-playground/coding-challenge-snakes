## Game rule ideas:

We want to promote getting longer and killing other snakes. Which rule should we use to promote this?

- snakes are ranked by how long they have survived. But there is a maximum game length and the snake length is used
- each x turns your snake grows (in addition to eating).

- time limit for calculating the moves? 0.2 max limit per move on average?
- aim for max 5 minutes
- 0.2 second calculation time, 5 steps/second,

Other rules brainstormed:

- when you create a loop, you kill every enemy inside it
- your final score is the highest length achieved
- your final score is the amount of kills achieved
- you are able to accelerate by going straight
- you can discard parts of your body to gain speed
- you have to eat an apple every x game steps, or your snake will die from hunger
- faster movement for longer snakes
